## explanation

In the logical model, I structured the data around a central movies collection. Each movie is represented as a single document that includes the following fields:

- _id: ObjectId – Unique identifier generated by MongoDB
- title: string – Title of the movie
- year: int – Release year of the movie
- director: ObjectId – Reference to a document in the directors collection
- genres: [string] – An array of genres assigned to the movie
- actors: [object] – An embedded array of actor objects, each with:
  - name: string
  - role: string
  - birthday: date

directors (Referenced Collection)
Each director is stored in its own document and includes:

- _id: ObjectId – Unique ID
- name: string – Director’s name
- birthdate: date – Date of birth
- nationality: string – Nationality
